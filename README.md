This project was a fun way for me to practice data cleaning and data visualisation using Excel and PowerBI respectively. The dataset used and tasks/KPIs were generated by ChatGPT as well.

This was such a fun experience and I will use this experience to grow more and challenge myself a lot more with more complex datasets and existing ones where I need to see what insight can be drawn from the data. I hope as well to use SQL soon to work with, manipulate, and use data.
